## DefMethod: Home assignment - java implementation

 #### My Approach 
      One of the goals i had for this assignment was to make the parse function as robust as possible. 
      
      Internally the parse function will generate a new person object based on the delimiter and the file being read from.


  ### Changelog ***
   - The main method has been refactored.
   - Improved sorting, functions are more autonomous.
   - Improved TDD - 6 new test cases.
   - Test functions are also improved and autonomous.
   - Updated README
